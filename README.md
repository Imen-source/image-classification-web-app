# Image Classification Web App

![AI Model Hub](frontend/public/vite.svg)

**AI Model Hub** is a full-stack web application for **image classification** using deep learning. Users can upload images, choose a model, and get real-time predictions with confidence scores. The project demonstrates expertise in **Python (FastAPI, PyTorch), TypeScript, React, and full-stack development**.

---

## Features

- **Dynamic Model Loading:** Load multiple pre-trained PyTorch models dynamically.
- **Image Classification:** Predict classes for Fashion MNIST images with confidence scores.
- **Frontend/Backend Integration:** Seamless communication between React frontend and FastAPI backend.
- **Responsive UI:** Built with TailwindCSS and Framer Motion for smooth animations.
- **File Upload Handling:** Supports image uploads and validates inputs.
- **Error Handling & Loading States:** Provides clear feedback during inference and model loading.

Sample Models
fashion_mnist_cnn – CNN trained on Fashion MNIST dataset.

Easily extendable: add more PyTorch models to backend/app/models/ and they will appear in the frontend.

Highlights of Technical Skills
Full-Stack Development: Connected React frontend with FastAPI backend.

Deep Learning Integration: Built a robust pipeline to handle PyTorch models dynamically.

Type Safety & API Communication: Used TypeScript interfaces and proper error handling.

UI/UX Skills: Interactive file uploads, model selector, and live predictions.

Problem Solving: Overcame challenges in model loading and prediction handling.

Future Improvements
Add multiple datasets and models for extended predictions.

Add user authentication for personalized model access.

Deploy as a cloud-based SaaS application.
